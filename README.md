# Code_Fight_Sol
I do Code fights because the problems are challenging and they help me to keep on learning. 
All of these problems are either solved or have small issues that I usually come back to.
Additionally I love their statements.

#KEEP ON LEARNING - Credited to CodeFights
Whenever you stop learning at work, it becomes just a job. 
CodeFights is fun to play but it also helps you learn, that's why it's not just a game. 
Similarly, working at CodeFights is not just a job. We push ourselves to learn and grow because it's the CodeFights way.
